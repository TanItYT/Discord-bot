# About the project
This github page was created to track the progress of my discord bot, see its changes and for people to see how I code it
I usally code using https://www.scratch-for-discord.com/ which is a useful tool to make code easy to understand but still has its flaws but overall great still good and I host the bot using repilt.com.
# Future plans
I don't really think other people will try to invite the bot to their servers because some features of the bot is restricted to my server like slash commands but its for anyone to see and fork the github.
